# How to contribute

I love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the thoughtbot code of conduct.

Fork, then clone the repo:
	git clone git@github.com:your-username/ARCADE-GAME-Udacity-Front-End-ND.git

Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on me.
I like to at least comment on pull requests within seven business days (and, typically, three business days).
I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

	- Write tests.
	- Follow javascript style guide.
	- Write a good commit message.
